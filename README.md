In this repo, find html pages to represent data from the WeatherPy repo.

I use Bootstrap to design pages to show scatter plots of the different relationships between weather elements - cloudiness, humidity, temperature, and wind speed - and latitude.

Find html for the various pages and the city data in the repo, and find the images in the assets folder.
